# CCC-Trans: Hue-preserving Color Image Enhancement Method Based on Convex Combination Coefficient Transformation

Authors: Yoshiaki Ueda and Noriaki Suetake

This repositry contains MATLAB code for the research paper <br>
**"CCC-Trans: Hue-preserving Color Image Enhancement Method Based on Convex
Combination Coefficient Transformation"** <br>
accepted in Franklin Open. 

This project includes functions for 
- calculating convex combination coefficients,
- calculating pure color of input pixels,
- transforming convex combination coefficients.

We also plan to provide Python version code.
<!-- We also provice Python version code in `https://`. -->
